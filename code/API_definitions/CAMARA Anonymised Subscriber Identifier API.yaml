  title: CAMARA Anonymised Subscriber Identifier API
  version: 0.0.0
  description: |
     The Anonymised Subscriber Identifier API provides an anonymised identifier, in the form of a UUID, for a mobile device subscription given the public source IP and port allocated to that device when it initiates a connection to a given application server (e.g. a public website).
     
     An application server can request the anonymised identitifier for the purposes of serving customised content (e.g. advertising or a customised home page) as the same identifier will be consistently returned to that server for a given subscriber irrespective of the IP and port allocated.
     
     However, the anonymised identifier will be specific to that application server (identified by OAuth credentials), and a different application server will receive a different identifier for the same mobile subscription. The anonymised identifier itself cannot be used to determine the true identity of the subscriber, and is not considered to be personal information.
